\node[draw,circle,scale=1.5,label=Segment $t_{n+1}$](2)[right=4cm of 1]{${a_t}_{n+1} , {e_t}_{n+1}$};

$a=$ action space: ${-5,...,5}$
 
$e =$ emotions vector 

${a_t}_{n+1} = Math.round({e_t}_{n+1}[\epsilon] - {e_t}_{n}[\epsilon] ) *5$ , where $\epsilon$ is a specific emotion.

This equation transfers the variation of emotions into the action space. $[-1..1] \rightarrow [-5...5]$

It means that a bigger variation in the player's emotions will cause a steeper change in difficulty.

At each step of the game, difficulty ${d_t}_{n+1} = {d_t}_{n} + {a_t}_n  $
